Structuring Machine Learning projects


Why ML?

- collect more data
- collect more diverse training set
- train algo longer with gradient descent
- try adam instead of gradient descent
- try bigger network
- try smaller network
- try dropout
- add l2 regularization
- network architecture
- activation functions
- hidden unit, etc


Week 1 - Learning Objectives
-----------------------------
* Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important
* Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
* Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
* Define human-level performance
* Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects
* Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset
