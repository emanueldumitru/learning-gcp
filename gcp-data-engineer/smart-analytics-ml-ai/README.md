Create a IAM service account

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-account --display-name my-account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:my-account@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/bigquery.admin
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=my-account@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=key.json
```


Big query pandas jupyterlab

```
%%bigquery df
SELECT
  departure_delay,
  COUNT(1) AS num_flights,
  APPROX_QUANTILES(arrival_delay, 10) AS arrival_delay_deciles
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
GROUP BY
  departure_delay
HAVING
  num_flights > 100
ORDER BY
  departure_delay ASC

Make predictions

```
SELECT

```


Make batch predictions

```
SELECT

    (
    SELECT
      start_station_name,
      start_date
